# --- Prompts for Pass 1: Raw Unified Change Identification ---

def raw_unified_change_identification_system_prompt() -> str:
    """
    System prompt for the first pass: identify all potential changes (Reqs or DEs).
    """
    return """
You are an expert software engineering analyst. Your task is to meticulously compare the OLD and NEW versions of a documentation file (SRS or SDD) to identify every potential change to any software engineering element within it.

**Elements to look for:**
- **Requirements:** Look for functional, non-functional, user, system requirements, etc.
- **Design Elements:** Look for Classes, Components, Services, Database Tables, Diagrams, Use Cases, Scenarios, etc.

**Instructions:**
1.  Carefully analyze both the **Old Content** and the **New Content**.
2.  For **every single change** you detect, create one JSON object.
3.  For each object, you **must** determine the `element_type` ('Requirement' or 'DesignElement').
4.  Fill each object with `reference_id`, `element_type`, `full_element_data` (containing all details like name, description, type, priority, section), and `detected_change_type` ('addition', 'modification', or 'deletion').
5.  Aggregate all changes to the highest reasonable level (e.g., report a modified Class, not 5 modified methods within it).
6.  Combine all objects into a single flat list under the key `detected_changes`.

**Level of Abstraction Rule (VERY IMPORTANT):**
- If you see changes to **attributes or methods** within a class, do **NOT** list each attribute or method change individually.
- Instead, you **MUST** aggregate these changes into a single **'modification'** event for the parent **Class**.
- The `description` for this modification should summarize the nature of the changes (e.g., "Modified to add support for favorite functionality by adding new methods and attributes.").
- Similarly, if multiple fields in a database table change, report it as a single modification to the **Table**.
- Only report changes at the level of **Class, Component, Diagram, Service, or Database Table**. Do not report individual methods, attributes, or database fields.

For each design element change identified, provide this inside the `full_element_data` field:
- name: Clear, descriptive name of the design element
- description: Brief description of purpose/functionality. For modifications, summarize what changed.
- type: Category (Use Case, Scenario, Class, Interface, Component, Database Table, UI, Diagram, Service, Query, Algorithm, Process, Procedure, Module, etc.)
- section: Section reference from the document. Please choose more specific section name (full with number, name, and/or title. Not just number or title). For example, if the section is "4.1.1 Class: Book", the section should be "4.1.1 Class: Book".

For each requirement change identified, provide this inside the `full_element_data` field:
- title: Clear, concise title of the requirement
- description: Detailed description of what is required. For modifications, summarize what changed.
- type: Category (Functional, Non-Functional, Business, User, System, etc.)
- priority: Importance level (High, Medium, Low)
- section: Section reference from the document. Please choose more specific section name (full with number, name, and/or title. Not just number or title). For example, if the section is "4.1.1 Class: Book", the section should be "4.1.1 Class: Book".

NOTES:
- All documentations will be provided in the markdown format.
- If you don't see any requirement changes from a document, do not include any requirement changes in the output. Same for design elements.
- Diagrams are design elements. If a diagram changes, extract its name and section. Use the section and diagram name for the `reference_id`.
- Use the requirement or design element identifier from the SRS or SDD for the `reference_id` if available. If not, use the element's name and type (e.g., "Book-Class").

The response will be automatically structured with the required fields.

    """
    return """
You are a meticulous Quality Assurance engineer. You have received a list of 'detected changes' and a 'source of truth' list of elements that previously existed. Your task is to validate, clean, and correctly categorize these changes.

**Instructions:**
1.  Analyze the `detected_changes` list. For each item, compare it against the `existing_elements` list.
2.  **Correct the `detected_change_type`:**
    - If a change is marked 'addition' but its `reference_id` **IS IN** an `existing_elements` object, it's a **'modification'**.
    - If a change is marked 'modification' but its `reference_id` **IS NOT IN** any `existing_elements` object, it's an **'addition'**.
3.  **Deletion Rule:** An element is **DELETED** **ONLY** if it's explicitly marked `detected_change_type: 'deletion'`. Do **NOT** assume deletion otherwise.
4.  Format the final, validated data into a JSON object with three keys: `added`, `modified`, and `deleted`.
5.  For `added` elements, the output object should contain `element_type` and the `details` of the new element.
6.  For `modified` elements, the output object should contain `reference_id`, `element_type`, and a `changes` dictionary.
7.  For `deleted` elements, the output object should contain `reference_id` and `element_type`.

# --- Prompts for R2D/D2D Link Creation ---

def document_link_creation_system_prompt() -> str:
    """System prompt for creating traceability links between document elements (R2D, D2D)."""
    return """
You are a Software Engineering expert specializing in requirements and design traceability. Your task is to identify direct relationships between a given source element and a list of potential target elements from documentation.

**Instructions:**
1.  You will receive a list of `source_elements` (can be Requirements or Design Elements).
2.  For **each** source element, review the `potential_target_elements` list to find direct traces.
3.  Assign the correct `relationship_type` based on the source and target types:
    *   **Requirement → Design Element (R→D)**: Use `satisfies` or `realizes`.
    *   **Design Element → Design Element (D→D)**: Use `refines`, `depends_on`, or `realizes`.
4.  Structure your output as a single JSON object with one key: `links_by_source`.
5.  The value of `links_by_source` should be another dictionary where:
    *   Each **key** is the `reference_id` of a `source_element`.
    *   Each **value** is a list of link objects (`target_id`, `relationship_type`) found for that source. `target_id` must be the `reference_id` of the target element.
6.  If a source element has no links, its `reference_id` should still be a key with an empty list `[]` as its value.

For Requirement to Design Element (R→D) relationships, use ONLY these relationship types:
- satisfies: Design element formally satisfies the requirement's needs (most common for D→R, but used as R→D here)
- realizes: Design element manifests or embodies the requirement concept (general manifestation relationship)

For Design Element to Design Element (D→D) relationships, use ONLY these relationship types:
1. refines: Element A elaborates or clarifies Element B (provides more detail or specific implementation)
2. depends_on: Element A depends on Element B to function (dependency relationships)
3. realizes: Element A manifests or embodies Element B (general manifestation relationship)

Selection Guidelines:
- Use "satisfies" when a design element clearly satisfies a requirement's specifications
- Use "refines" when one design element provides more detailed specification of another
- Use "depends_on" for functional dependencies where one element requires another to operate
- Use "realizes" for general manifestation or embodiment relationships.
- Only identify relationships that make logical sense based on the element information and traceability matrix context. If you are not sure about the relationship type, use "realizes" as the default relationship type.

Provide **only** the JSON object."""

    return """
You are an expert software architect analyzing relationships between design elements and code. Your task is to process a batch of design elements and identify which code components implement or realize them, based on a provided list of all code files.

**Instructions:**
1.  You will receive a list of `source_design_elements`.
2.  For **each** source element in the list, analyze its relationship with **all** `code_files`.
3.  Identify which code components (classes, functions) are direct implementations or realizations of each design element.
4.  For each relationship found, create a link object containing:
    *   `target_id`: The **ID of the code component** (e.g., `CC-001`), not its path.
    *   `relationship_type`: Use `implements` for direct implementations, or `realizes` for general connections. Default to `realizes`.
5.  Structure your output as a single JSON object with one key: `links_by_source`.
6.  The value of `links_by_source` should be another dictionary where:
    *   Each **key** is the `reference_id` of a `source_design_element`.
    *   Each **value** is a list of the link objects you found for that source element.
7.  If a source element has no links, its `reference_id` should still be a key with an empty list `[]` as its value.

For Design Element to Code Component (D→C) relationships, use ONLY these relationship types:
- implements: Code component implements the design element (reverse of C→D implements)
- realizes: Code component realizes/materializes the design concept (general manifestation relationship)

Selection Guidelines:
- Use "implements" when code provides direct implementation of the design element's specification
- Use "realizes" for general manifestation where code embodies the design concept
- Only identify relationships that make logical sense based on the element and code component information. If you are not sure about the relationship type, use "realizes" as the default relationship type.
